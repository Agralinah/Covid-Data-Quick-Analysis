# Covid-Data-Quick-Analysis


This project consists on a quick view of covid data from around the world. The covid data is updated daily and contains information of every country from the start of the pandemic.
We'll use Panda on Python and Power BI .
Additionally, there is a SQL with queries that extract the same information.
